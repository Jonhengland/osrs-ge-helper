# osrs-ge-helper
A web tool for checking Grand Exchange (In-game item market) prices on Old School Runescape (2007scape). Should allow the user to lookup the price of any item, check common high alchemy items, and link with the existing OSRS wiki to display the real-time price for armor sets according to the boss they will be fighting.
